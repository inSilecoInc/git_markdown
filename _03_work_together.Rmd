# Branching

![:custom_hr]()

## `r gt()` killer feature


---
# Branch, branch and branch! 

--

### 1. Branch to create divergent history.

--

### 2. Creating a branch is cheap!

--

### 3. **Basic workflow**: Develop on a topic branch, merge it with the master once it's ready then delete it.



---
# Branching

```sh
$ git branch topicA
$ git switch topicA
#> Switched to branch 'topicA'
```

# Merging `git merge`

```sh
$ git switch main 
$ git merge topicA 
#> Updating 64ee016..aadf541
#> Fast-forward
#>  seq_ncol.R | 1 +
#>  1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
#>  create mode 100644 seq_ncol.R
```

.center[![:scale 90%](img/part2/br2_3.png)]


---
# `r lc()` Let's do this 
 
### 4 pieces of advice 

- List your branch with `git branch`
- Use `git status` 
- Use `git log`
- Once a branch is merged, delete it `git branch -d topicA`

# Pull requests 

## What are they?

> Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. 



.font80[`r nf()` Go [Here](https://co-learning.eu/2017/10/04/why-and-how-do-we-use-pull-request/) for all you need to know on pull requests on `r gh()`]

---
# Pull requests 

## Why use them?

- Code review
- Test and validate code 
- Find errors or improvement opportunities 
- Education / training of other developers
- Allow less experienced coder to contribute without worrying they will mess up the main project

.font80[`r nf()` [Here](https://co-learning.eu/2017/10/04/why-and-how-do-we-use-pull-request/) is a nice blog post on the benefits of using pull requests for co-development]
